function trialTypeMatrix = make_trialTypeMatrix(nReps,nFactors,nLevelsPerFactor)
%============================================
% Function: make_trialTypeMatrix
% Purpose:  Sets up a matrix that can serve as condition indexes. The
%           matrix has as many rows are there are trials. The number of
%           trials is determined by the nReps*prod(nLevelsPerFactor).
%           Each column is a factor. The intent is that the values can
%           be used as indicies or identifiers for different levels of
%           that factor.
% Usage:    
% trialTypeMatrix = make_trialTypeMatrix(nReps,nFactors,nLevelsPerFactor)
%
% Input:    nReps:       The number of replications of all the conditions
%           nFactors:    The number of conditions or factors in the design
%           nLevelsPerFactor: A column vector that is 1 x nFactors in
%           length. Each entry holds the number of levels of that
%           condition.
%
% Output:   trialTypeMatrix: A 2-D matrix that is nTrials long
%                            (nReps*prod(nLevelsPerFactor)) and
%                            has as many columns as factors.
